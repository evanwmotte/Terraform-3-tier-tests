# Terraform-3-tier-tests

Hey guys, the Azure part of this works all fine and dandy but unfortunately I got a little bored when working on AWS and GCP and ended up looking into more complex
terraform things. So the AWS piece is in a decent spot but it's not set up with variables or working. Just keep that in mind. But this is what I've been working on.
Simple 3 tier architecture for deploying applications. The AWS and GCP pieces are similar just with different resources obviously. There's also examples of dynamic
lookups in some of the aws modules. Hope this helps. Thanks.
